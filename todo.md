# TODO


* update influxdb.py to use win_size from configuration 
* enumerate dependencies
* consolidate configuration 
  * Influx-DB and how to configure the client (IP,port of influx server is some configuration file parameter).
  * Same with TorchServe? [Its there in /jetson but including it in the main setup file will provide an overview of all dependencies immediately]
* single setup script
