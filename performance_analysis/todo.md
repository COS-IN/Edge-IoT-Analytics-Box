# Performance Analysis 

## End goal / Deliverable (Reason)

  Measure inference times, energy cost, utilization of a single experiment. 
  Perform experiments for multiple sensor count. 

## Next Actions (Planning)

  * setup for single experiment  
    * [x] measuring inference time 
      * [x] update analytics to spit out inference time
    * measuring energy cost 
      * capturing tegrastats output 
    * setting up jetson for the experiment 
    * measuring metrices 
    * cleaning up afterwards 
  * post process the experiment 
  * repeat the experiments for following set  
  * post process collective results  
  * update report
